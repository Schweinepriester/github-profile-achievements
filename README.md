## Official list

There ~~is~~ was an official list available in the GitHub Docs at  
<https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#displaying-badges-on-your-profile>,  
which includes specifics on how badges were/are awarded, e.g. which [repositories and versions qualified for the Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement).

~~Consider this repository a mirror, maybe in the future with historic purpose.~~ Unless there will be an offical list again, this is it.

## Previous versions

### 2021-04-19 - 2022-06-09

From the [start with Ingenuity on 2021-04-19](https://github.blog/2021-04-19-open-source-goes-to-mars/) until the [additions on 2022-06-09](https://github.blog/2022-06-09-introducing-achievements-recognizing-the-many-stages-of-a-developers-coding-journey/), the first three Achievements had a different design. In other words, they were overhauled on 2022-06-09.

Here are the old designs:
